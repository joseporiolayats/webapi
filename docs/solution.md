# **Proposed Solution Documentation**

This document describes the proposed solution for the WebAPI code assessment, a backend API service created using Python and FastAPI. The goal of this service is to provide a modern, secure, and extensible API for managing user data and policies.

## **Overview**

The backend API service aims to provide the following features:



1. Retrieve user data filtered by user ID or user name.
2. Retrieve the list of policies linked to a user name.
3. Retrieve the user linked to a policy number.

Access to these features is restricted based on the user's role, as described in the requirements.


## **Requirements**

The service is designed to meet the following requirements:



* Get user data filtered by user ID. Accessed by roles "users" and "admin".
* Get user data filtered by user name. Accessed by roles "users" and "admin".
* Get the list of policies linked to a user name. Accessed by role "admin".
* Get the user linked to a policy number. Accessed by role "admin".


## **Solution Architecture**

The proposed solution uses FastAPI, a modern and high-performance Python web framework, to create the API endpoints. FastAPI is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, offering excellent performance, easy-to-use data validation, and automatic API documentation generation.

The application is divided into several modules and components, including:



* `main.py`: The main FastAPI application entry point.
* `models.py`: Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
* `routers/`: Router modules for organizing and handling API endpoints.
* `data/`: Modules for handling data storage and retrieval, including the MongoDB Atlas database connection and caching.
* `authentication.py`: Module for handling user authentication and authorization.


## **Technologies Used**

The key technologies used in the solution include:



* FastAPI: A modern, high-performance Python web framework.
* MongoDB Atlas: A fully managed, global cloud database service for MongoDB.
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
* Pydantic: A data validation and parsing library for Python.
* HTTPie: A user-friendly command-line HTTP client for API testing.


## **Authentication and Authorization**

The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. After a user registers or logs in, a JWT token is returned. This token must be included in the `Authorization` header for all requests to restricted endpoints. The user's role is taken from the web service that returns the list of company clients and is used to control access to specific endpoints based on the role requirements.


## **Code Structure and Patterns**

The solution follows a modular and organized code structure to ensure maintainability and extensibility. The key patterns used include:



* Router modules: FastAPI routers are used to organize and separate the API endpoints into logical groups.
* Dependency injection: FastAPI's dependency injection system is used to provide shared resources such as the database connection and authentication components.
* Data access layer: The `data/` directory contains modules for handling data storage and retrieval, separating these concerns from the API endpoints.


## **Error Handling and Quality Assurance**

The solution includes error handling and logging to ensure product quality and maintainability. FastAPI's built-in exception handling is used to catch and handle errors gracefully, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. The application also uses a custom logger to log errors and other important events, making it easier to diagnose and resolve issues.

To further ensure product quality, unit tests and integration tests can be written to cover the critical functionality of the application. FastAPI's built-in test client can be used to simulate API requests and validate the responses. By implementing a comprehensive test suite, the application's stability and reliability can be maintained as new features are added or existing features are modified.


## **Documentation**

Documentation plays a crucial role in helping developers understand and use the API effectively. The FastAPI application automatically generates API documentation using the OpenAPI and JSON Schema standards. This interactive documentation, available at `/docs` and `/redoc` by default, allows developers to explore the API endpoints, view the expected request and response formats, and even try out the API directly from their browser.

In addition to the auto-generated API documentation, a comprehensive user guide and reference documentation can be created using tools like MkDocs or Sphinx. This documentation should cover topics such as setting up the application, authentication and authorization, example usage of the API endpoints, and any additional information necessary for developers to work effectively with the API.

By providing clear and up-to-date documentation, the API will be more accessible to developers, making it easier for them to build applications that integrate with the backend service.
